# Minimal Rails App

This constitutes the bare minimum rails app with layouts and views.

## Getting Started

Check out the contents of `config.ru`.

Install gems with:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

To start the server, simply run:

```sh
$ puma
```

There is also a VS Code `.devcontainer` configuration if you're into that sort of thing.  Still need to run `puma` in the container.
